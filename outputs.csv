To assist the public health community in better serving these individuals, the American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute collaborate triennially to estimate cancer prevalence in the United States using incidence and survival data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer registries, vital statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for Health Statistics, and population projections from the US Census Bureau. Current treatment patterns based on information in the National Cancer Database are presented for the most prevalent cancer types by race, and cancer‐related and treatment‐related side‐effects are also briefly described. More than 18 million Americans (8.3 million males and 9.7 million females) with a history of cancer were alive on January 1, 2022. The 3 most prevalent cancers are prostate (3,523,230), melanoma of the skin (760,640), and colon and rectum (726,450) among males and breast (4,055,770), uterine corpus (891,560), and thyroid (823,800) among females. More than one‐half (53%) of survivors were diagnosed within the past 10 years, and two‐thirds (67%) were aged 65 years or older. One of the largest racial disparities in treatment is for rectal cancer, for which 41% of Black patients with stage I disease receive proctectomy or proctocolectomy compared to 66% of White patients. Surgical receipt is also substantially lower among Black patients with non‐small cell lung cancer, 49% for stages I‐II and 16% for stage III versus 55% and 22% for White patients, respectively. These treatment disparities are exacerbated by the fact that Black patients continue to be less likely to be diagnosed with stage I disease than White patients for most cancers, with some of the largest disparities for female breast (53% vs 68%) and endometrial (59% vs 73%). Although there are a growing number of tools that can assist patients, caregivers, and clinicians in navigating the various phases of cancer survivorship, further evidence‐based strategies and equitable access to available resources are needed to mitigate disparities for communities of color and optimize care for people with a history of cancer.

The standardized management of the diagnosis and treatment of gastric cancer is challenging due to the great differences in the diagnosis and treatment of gastric cancer in different regions. The Gastric Cancer Expert Committee of the National Cancer Quality Control Center (NCQCC) identified a lack of authoritative quality control standards as an opportunity to utilize its multidisciplinary membership to improve the standardized diagnosis and treatment of gastric cancer. The Gastric Cancer Expert Committee of the NCQCC aims to promote quality control and national standardization, uniformity, and normalization of gastric cancer diagnosis and treatment, which ultimately improved the survival rate and quality of life of gastric cancer patients. A panel of experts with gastrointestinal cancer surgery, gastrointestinal cancer medicine, medical imaging, pathology and radiotherapy were drawn together and determined the quality control standards for the standardized diagnosis and treatment of gastric cancer.

Several new randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have recently reported additional results on the safety and efficacy of DOACs in this setting. We performed an updated meta-analysis of all publicly available data from RCTs comparing DOACs with LMWHs for the treatment of CAT. Six RCTs enrolling 3690 patients with CAT were included. Compared with LMWHs, DOACs significantly decreased the risk of CAT recurrence (RR, 0.67; 95%CI, 0.52–0.85), with a non-significant increase in the risk of major bleeding (RR, 1.17; 95%CI, 0.82–1.67), a significant increase in the risk of clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding (RR 1.66; 95%CI, 1.31–2.09) and no difference in all-cause mortality rates.

As of now in year 2022, systemic chemotherapy remains as the mainstay treatment option for patients with advanced staged gallbladder cancer. Despite decades of scientific research, new treatment options have been struggling to succeed. Furthermore, almost all clinical studies on gallbladder cancer have included other tyes of biliary tract cancers, raising the need to specifically inspect the outcomes of these clinical trial regimens on gallbladder cancer. In this article, we summarized all seminal literature and the most recent advances in scientific discoveries and clinical trials on gallbladder cancer. We provide a succinct update on current understanding, treatment landscape and therapeutic challenges in gallbladder cancer, as well as future prospects in the management of this disease. Abstract Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is a biological, anatomical, and clinically distinct subset of biliary tract cancers (BTC), which also include extra- and intra-hepatic cholangiocarcinoma. The advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) clearly shows that GBC is genetically different from cholangiocarcinoma. Although GBC is a relatively rare cancer, it is highly aggressive and carries a grave prognosis. To date, complete surgical resection remains the only path for cure but is limited to patients with early-stage disease. The majority of the patients are diagnosed at an advanced, inoperable stage when systemic treatment is administered as an attempt to enable surgery or for palliation. Gemcitabine and platinum-based chemotherapies have been the main treatment modality for unresectable, locally advanced, and metastatic gallbladder cancer. However, over the past decade, the treatment paradigm has evolved. These include the introduction of newer chemotherapeutic strategies after progression on frontline chemotherapy, incorporation of targeted therapeutics towards driver mutations of genes including HER2, FGFR, BRAF, as well as approaches to unleash host anti-tumor immunity using immune checkpoint inhibitors. Notably, due to the rarity of BTC in general, most clinical trials included both GBC and cholangiocarcinomas. Here, we provide a review on the pathogenesis of GBC, past and current systemic treatment options focusing specifically on GBC, clinical trials tailored towards its genetic mutations, and emerging treatment strategies based on promising recent clinical studies.","https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/14/5/1249/pdf?version=1646103968"

In addition, other drugs are under development. A number of studies have been published over the past year which have shown either an advantage for progression-free survival or for overall survival. This review summarizes the latest results, which have been published at current congresses or in specialist journals, and classifies them in the clinical treatment context. In particular, the importance of therapy with CDK4/6 inhibitors – trastuzumab deruxtecan, sacituzumab govitecan and capivasertib – is discussed. For trastuzumab deruxtecan, an overall survival benefit in HER2-negative breast cancer with low HER2 expression (HER2-low expression) was reported in the Destiny-Breast-04 study. Similarly, there was an overall survival benefit in the FAKTION study with capivasertib. The lack of overall survival benefit for palbociclib in the first line of therapy raises the question of clinical classification.

It can cause indigestion, gastritis, peptic ulcer, and gastric cancer. H. pylori eradication treatment can effectively control disease progression and reduce the risk of the above conditions. However, the escalating trend of antibiotic resistance presents a global challenge for H. pylori eradication. We aim to provide guidance on pharmacological treatment of H. pylori infection. Methods: This clinical practice guideline is developed following the World Health Organization's recommended process, adopting Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation in assessing evidence quality, and utilizing Evidence to Decision framework to formulate clinical recommendations, minimizing bias and increasing transparency of the clinical practice guideline development process. We used the Reporting Items for practice Guidelines in HealThcare (RIGHT) statement and The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II) as reporting and conduct guides to ensure the guideline's completeness and transparency. Results: Though decreasing in developed countries, the prevalence of H. pylori remains high in developing countries, causing a major public health burden. This clinical practice guideline contains 12 recommendations concerning pharmacological treatment for H. pylori eradication. Among them, it is worth highlighting that bismuth preparations are inexpensive, safe, and effective, consequently making bismuth quadruple therapy a preferred choice for initial and rescue treatment. In empirical treatment, high-dose dual therapy is equally effective compared with bismuth quadruple therapy. Conclusions: The 12 recommendations in this clinical practice guideline are formed with consideration for stakeholders’ values and preferences, resource use, feasibility, and acceptability. Recommendations are generalizable to resource limited settings with similar antibiotic resistance pattern as China, and lower middle-income countries facing comparable sociological and technical challenges.

In Europe, only pembrolizumab in the first line and the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab beyond the first line are approved. Many questions remain about the clinical management of MSI-H/dMMR CRC. Biomarkers predictive of immune checkpoint inhibitor resistance among MSI-H/dMMR tumors are needed (1) to select the best treatment for patients with CRC (anti-PD-[L]1 monotherapy alone or combined with anti-CTLA-4 or chemotherapy) and (2) to develop new treatment strategies for patients whose disease progressed after immune checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy. The development of immune checkpoint inhibitors in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings is also of great interest for patients harboring MSI-H/dMMR, especially as a substantial proportion have Lynch syndrome or are at high risk of developing cancers in their lifetime and sporadic MSI-H/dMMR cancers occur most frequently in elderly and frail patients. Thus, CRC is not one, but two different diseases: (1) MSI-H/dMMR CRC (seen in 5% of mCRC and 15% of non-mCRC), which is genetically unstable with a high mutational load and many neoantigens, and for which immune checkpoint inhibitors radically changed clinical management, and (2) microsatellite stable CRC with chromosomal instability, for which immune checkpoint inhibitors are not proven efficient.","https://ascopubs.org/doi/pdfdirect/10.1200/EDBK_349557"
"caa57c7de9250f254d12c3232116ba99c4218f5c","AGO Recommendations for the Surgical Therapy of Breast Cancer: Update 2022","2022","Abstract The recommendations of the AGO Breast Committee on the surgical therapy of breast cancer were last updated in March 2022 (www.ago-online.de). Since surgical therapy is one of several partial steps in the treatment of breast cancer, extensive diagnostic and oncological expertise of a breast surgeon and good interdisciplinary cooperation with diagnostic radiologists is of great importance. The most important changes concern localization techniques, resection margins, axillary management in the neoadjuvant setting and the evaluation of the meshes in reconstructive surgery. Based on meta-analyses of randomized studies, the level of recommendation of an intraoperative breast ultrasound for the localization of non-palpable lesions was elevated to “++”. Thus, the technique is considered to be equivalent to wire localization, provided that it is a lesion which can be well represented by sonography, the surgeon has extensive experience in breast ultrasound and has access to a suitable ultrasound device during the operation. In invasive breast cancer, the aim is to reach negative resection margins (“no tumor on ink”), regardless of whether an extensive intraductal component is present or not. Oncoplastic operations can also replace a mastectomy in selected cases due to the large number of existing techniques, and are equivalent to segmental resection in terms of oncological safety at comparable rates of complications. Sentinel node excision is recommended for patients with cN0 status receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy after completion of chemotherapy. Minimally invasive biopsy is recommended for initially suspect lymph nodes. After neoadjuvant chemotherapy, patients with initially 1 – 3 suspicious lymph nodes and a good response (ycN0) can receive the targeted axillary dissection and the axillary dissection as equivalent options. Zusammenfassung Die Empfehlungen der AGO Kommission Mamma zur operativen Therapie des Mammakarzinoms wurden zuletzt im März 2022 aktualisiert (www.ago-online.de). Da die operative Therapie einen von mehreren Teilschritten bei der Behandlung des Mammakarzinoms darstellt, ist eine umfangreiche diagnostische und onkologische Expertise eines Brustoperateurs und gute interdisziplinäre Zusammenarbeit mit den diagnostischen Radiologen von großer Bedeutung. Die wichtigsten Änderungen betreffen die Lokalisationstechniken, die Resektionsränder, das axilläre Management im neoadjuvanten Setting und die Bewertung der Netze in der rekonstruktiven Chirurgie. Aufgrund von Metanaanalysen randomisierter Studien wurde der Empfehlungsgrad der intraoperativen Mammasonografie zur Lokalisation nicht palpabler Befunde auf „++“ erhöht. Somit wird die Technik als gleichwertig zur Drahtlokalisation angesehen, vorausgesetzt, es handelt sich um eine sonografisch gut darstellbare Läsion, der Operateur verfügt über umfangreiche Kenntnisse in der Mammasonografie und hat Zugang zu einem geeigneten Ultraschallgerät während der Operation. Beim invasiven Mammakarzinom wird das Erreichen von negativen Resektionsrändern („no tumor on ink“) angestrebt, unabhängig davon, ob eine extensive intraduktale Komponente vorliegt oder nicht. Onkoplastische Operationen können durch die Vielzahl der existierenden Techniken in ausgewählten Fällen auch eine Mastektomie ersetzen und sind im Vergleich zu einer regulären Segmentresektion hinsichtlich der onkologischen Sicherheit bei vergleichbaren Komplikationsraten gleichwertig. Patientinnen mit cN0-Status, die eine neoadjuvante Chemotherapie erhalten, wird eine Sentinel-Node-Exzision nach Abschluss der Chemotherapie empfohlen. Bei initial suspekten Lymphknoten wird die minimalinvasive Sicherung empfohlen. Nach der neoadjuvanten Chemotherapie stehen Patientinnen mit initial 1 – 3 suspekten Lymphknoten und gutem Ansprechen (ycN0) die Targeted axillary Dissection und die Axilladissektion als gleichwertige Optionen zur Verfügung.","http://www.thieme-connect.de/products/ejournals/pdf/10.1055/a-1904-6231.pdf"

Sci. 29/2022)","2022","Programmed death‐ligand 1 (PD‐L1) is a major target to cancer immunotherapy, and anti‐PD‐L1 and anti‐PD‐1 antibody‐mediated immunotherapy are being increasingly used. However, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are ineffective in treating large tumors and cause various immune‐related adverse events in nontarget organs, including life‐threatening cardiotoxicity. Therefore, the development of new therapeutic strategies to overcome these limitations is crucial. The focus of this study is the forkhead box protein M1 (FOXM1), which is identified as a potential therapeutic target for cancer immunotherapy and is associated with the modulation of PD‐L1 expression. Selective small interfering RNA knockdown of FOXM1 or treatment with thiostrepton (TST) significantly reduces PD‐L1 expression in non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells and inhibits proliferation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation‐PCR reveals that FOXM1 selectively upregulates PD‐L1 expression by binding directly to the PD‐L1 promoter. In vivo animal studies have shown that TST treatment significantly downregulates PD‐L1 expression in human NSCLC tumors, while greatly reducing tumor size without side effects on normal tissues. Combined treatment with TST and anti‐4‐1BB antibody in the LLC‐1 syngeneic tumor model induces synergistic therapeutic outcomes against immune resistant lung tumors as well as 2.72‐folds higher CD3+ T cells in tumor tissues compared to that in the anti‐4‐1BB antibody treatment group.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/advs.202202702"

Protocols with high evidence level and good availability are used as the Level I recommendations; protocols with relatively high evidence level but slightly lower expert consensus or with poor availability are used as the Level II recommendations; and protocols that are clinically applicable but with low evidence level are regarded as the Level III recommendations. Based on the findings of clinical research at home and abroad and the opinions of CSCO experts, the CSCO guidelines determine the levels of recommendations for clinical application. The CSCO Guidance Working Group firmly believes that evidence-based, availability-concerned, and consensus-based guidelines will be more feasible for clinical practice. Again, any comments from our readers are greatly appreciated and will be considered in updates of these guidelines, so as to maintain the accuracy, fairness, and timeliness of the CSCO guidelines.","https://tbcr.amegroups.com/article/viewFile/63879/pdf"

Radiation therapy plays a key-role in the treatment of all breast cancer stages. Therefore, the adoption of evidence-based treatments is warranted, to ensure equity of access and standardization of care in clinical practice. Method: This national document on the highest evidence-based available data was developed and endorsed by the Italian Association of Radiation and Clinical Oncology (AIRO) Breast Cancer Group. We analyzed literature data regarding breast radiation therapy, using the SIGN (Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network) methodology (www.sign.ac.uk). Updated findings from the literature were examined, including the highest levels of evidence (meta-analyses, randomized trials, and international guidelines) with a significant impact on clinical practice. The document deals with the role of radiation therapy in the treatment of primary breast cancer, local relapse, and metastatic disease, with focus on diagnosis, staging, local and systemic therapies, and follow up. Information is given on indications, techniques, total doses, and fractionations. Results: An extensive literature review from 2013 to 2021 was performed. The work was organized according to a general index of different topics and most chapters included individual questions and, when possible, synoptic and summary tables. Indications for radiation therapy in breast cancer were examined and integrated with other oncological treatments. A total of 50 questions were analyzed and answered. Four large areas of interest were investigated: (1) general strategy (multidisciplinary approach, contraindications, preliminary assessments, staging and management of patients with electronic devices); (2) systemic therapy (primary, adjuvant, in metastatic setting); (3) clinical aspects (invasive, non-invasive and micro-invasive carcinoma; particular situations such as young and elderly patients, breast cancer in males and cancer during pregnancy; follow up with possible acute and late toxicities; loco-regional relapse and metastatic disease); (4) technical aspects (radiation after conservative surgery or mastectomy, indications for boost, lymph node radiotherapy and partial breast irradiation). Appendixes about tumor bed boost and breast and lymph nodes contouring were implemented, including a dedicated web application. The scientific work was reviewed and validated by an expert group of breast cancer key-opinion leaders. Conclusions: Optimal breast cancer management requires a multidisciplinary approach sharing therapeutic strategies with the other involved specialists and the patient, within a coordinated and dedicated clinical path. In recent years, the high-level quality radiation therapy has shown a significant impact on local control and survival of breast cancer patients. Therefore, it is necessary to offer and guarantee accurate treatments according to the best standards of evidence-based medicine.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/03008916221088885"
"db6888b4167aba9e06cfc23aeda6090050d401df","Breast Cancer in Indonesia in 2022: 30 Years of Marching in Place","2022","Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer in Indonesia, 19.2% out of all cancers [1]. In 1992, most breast cancer patients (60-70%) sought medical treatment when the cancers were in late stages (stage III and IV) [2]. Thirty years later data collected from several teaching hospitals in Indonesia shows that 68- 73% of breast cancer patients come to medical centers in the late stages [3,4,5]. It is interesting to learn why the number of late-stage breast cancer patients in Indonesia remains the same despite the advancement in early detection and therapeutical measures. This editorial will mainly discuss one factor contributing to the diagnostic and treatment delay: patients’ accessibility to proper medical attention. Accessibility to proper medical attention for breast cancer patients in Indonesia depends on the number and distribution of trained oncologists, a concise referral system, and supportive regulation. Indonesia is a vast archipelago country with a population of more than 273 million people. In tertiary medical centers, breast cancer patients are attended by surgical oncologists since surgery is the main treatment. As per February 2002, there are only 233 surgical oncologists practicing. This number is far below the ratio proposed by the Indonesian Society of Surgical Oncologists (Perhimpunan Ahli Bedah Onkologi Indonesia/PERABOI) which is 0.2 per 100,000 population (546 surgical oncologists needed). This number is still below the ideal ratio which is twice as much. However, setting a goal too high would make the organization frustrated, hence the revised target. The role of oncologists is vital in breast cancer cases. A multinational analysis shows that being diagnosed with breast cancer by an oncologist correlates with shorter treatment delay [6]. It takes at least 6 years of general surgery training plus 2 more years of surgical oncology training to produce a surgical oncologist. This does not count the 2-5 years of working experience required before a general surgeon could apply for the surgical oncologist training. Acceleration is critical to producing more surgical oncologists, either by establishing more training centers or by modifying the training system. Establishing a surgical oncology training center is no simple procedure; especially since UU Pendidikan Kedokteran number 20/ 2013 mandates that medical specialist training must be university-based [7]. The government should consider the role of hospital-based training to accelerate the production of surgical oncologists. The revision of the law is underway that would recognize the role of professional society and collegium in medical specialist training. Acceleration can also be carried out through modifying the training system: from subspecialist training to specialist training. A general practitioner can enroll for the surgical oncology training without having to be a general surgeon first. The role of “collegium” is vital to ensure that the training curricula meet the requirement despite the cutting down of training time. Nevertheless, modification of the training system will take years unless there is government intervention to simplify the regulations. Another alternative to increase the number of competent surgeons attending breast cancer patients is by establishing a crash program in surgical oncology for general surgeons. The program would train general surgeons in early detection, proper treatment, and the vital knowledge of “when to refer” to tertiary medical centers so that the patients could have the best possible treatment. The lack in the number of surgical oncologists is worsened by the uneven distribution throughout the country. More than 50% practice in big cities in Java Island leaving some distant provinces with only one or two surgical oncologists. Distribution is vital so that expert medical advice is accessible throughout the country. The public health system and private insurance may cover the direct cost of breast cancer care but not the indirect costs such as traveling expenses to reach distant medical centers. The indirect cost is one factor contributing to patients’ delay to seek breast cancer care [8,9]. A study in Yogyakarta shows that various out-of-pocket expenses such as transportation and logistics linked to presentation, diagnosis, and subsequent breast cancer treatment remain a financial burden and hinder the patient from seeking early medical treatment [10]. The government needs to work closely together with the Society to regulate the distribution of surgical oncologists throughout the country. Indonesian Journal of Cancer, Vol 16(1), 1–2, March 2022 DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.33371/ijoc.v16i1.920 www.indonesianjournalofcancer.or.id P-ISSN: 1978-3744 E-ISSN: 2355-6811 2 | A breast cancer referral system that concisely states “what and when” to refer to tertiary medical care is necessary to prevent referral delay. A study in a tertiary medical center in Surabaya shows that only 13,8% of the patient comes through the referral system [11]. This shows some dysfunctions in our country’s referral system. It is necessary to prepare a breast cancer referral guideline for physicians in primary and secondary medical centers. Lack of concise referral guidelines may result in some early breast cancer patients getting inadequate surgical oncology treatment in secondary medical centers and later coming to the tertiary medical center in a more advanced stage. Reformation of some regulations is imperative in ensuring patient access to proper medical attention. Laws that regulate medical specialist training need to be reformed in order to accelerate the production and national distribution of much demanded surgical oncologists. It is necessary to establish regulation on the breast cancer referral system to avoid referral delay in secondary medical centers. There is also an urgent need to re-evaluate the regulation of the national health financing system, which often contributes to hospital delay of breast cancer treatment. Aiming for reducing the number of late-stage breast cancer in Indonesia is a gigantic work. From the medical standpoint, it is crucial that breast cancer patients have access to proper medical attention as early as possible. Accelerating the production of surgical oncologists, ensuring their even distribution throughout the country, improving the breast cancer referral system, and reforming some regulations are indispensable measures to take. Thirty years ago, we had 60-70% late-stage breast cancer. Nowadays sadly we have similar numbers. And if we do not take necessary actions, thirty years from now we will not see much difference in the number. It would seem that breast cancer care in Indonesia is marching in place.","https://www.indonesianjournalofcancer.or.id/e-journal/index.php/ijoc/article/download/920/418"

We report the results from the ATHENA–MONO comparison of rucaparib versus placebo. METHODS Patients with stage III-IV high-grade ovarian cancer undergoing surgical cytoreduction (R0/complete resection permitted) and responding to first-line platinum-doublet chemotherapy were randomly assigned 4:1 to oral rucaparib 600 mg twice a day or placebo. Stratification factors were HRD test status, residual disease after chemotherapy, and timing of surgery. The primary end point of investigator-assessed progression-free survival was assessed in a step-down procedure, first in the HRD population (BRCA-mutant or BRCA wild-type/loss of heterozygosity high tumor), and then in the intent-to-treat population. RESULTS As of March 23, 2022 (data cutoff), 427 and 111 patients were randomly assigned to rucaparib or placebo, respectively (HRD population: 185 v 49). Median progression-free survival (95% CI) was 28.7 months (23.0 to not reached) with rucaparib versus 11.3 months (9.1 to 22.1) with placebo in the HRD population (log-rank P = .0004; hazard ratio [HR], 0.47; 95% CI, 0.31 to 0.72); 20.2 months (15.2 to 24.7) versus 9.2 months (8.3 to 12.2) in the intent-to-treat population (log-rank P < .0001; HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.40 to 0.68); and 12.1 months (11.1 to 17.7) versus 9.1 months (4.0 to 12.2) in the HRD-negative population (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.95). The most common grade ≥ 3 treatment-emergent adverse events were anemia (rucaparib, 28.7% v placebo, 0%) and neutropenia (14.6% v 0.9%). CONCLUSION Rucaparib monotherapy is effective as first-line maintenance, conferring significant benefit versus placebo in patients with advanced ovarian cancer with and without HRD.","https://ascopubs.org/doi/pdfdirect/10.1200/JCO.22.01003?role=tab"

Seventy percent of these patients are nulliparous at the time. Decision making regarding fertility preservation in early stage endometrial cancer (ES-EC) is, therefore, a big challenge since the decision between the risk of cancer progression and a chance to parenthood needs to be made. Sixty-two percent of women with complete remission of ES-EC after fertility-sparing treatment (FST) report to have a pregnancy wish which, if not for FST, they would not be able to fulfil. The aim of this review was to identify and summarise the currently established biomolecular and genetic prognostic factors that can facilitate decision making for FST in ES-EC. A comprehensive search strategy was carried out across four databases; Cochrane, Embase, MEDLINE, and PubMed; they were searched between March 1946 and 22nd December 2022. Thirty-four studies were included in this study which was conducted in line with the PRISMA criteria checklist. The final 34 articles encompassed 9165 patients. The studies were assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP). PTEN and POLE alterations we found to be good prognostic factors of ES-EC, favouring FST. MSI, CTNNB1, and K-RAS alterations were found to be fair prognostic factors of ES-EC, favouring FST but carrying a risk of recurrence. PIK3CA, HER2, ARID1A, P53, L1CAM, and FGFR2 were found to be poor prognostic factors of ES-EC and therefore do not favour FST. Clinical trials with bigger cohorts are needed to further validate the fair genetic prognostic factors. Using the aforementioned good and poor genetic prognostic factors, we can make more confident decisions on FST in ES-EC.","https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/23/5/2653/pdf?version=1646047670"

Chemo-radiation followed by interventional radiotherapy (IRT) is the standard of care for stage IB–IVA FIGO. Several studies have shown that image-guided adaptive IRT resulted in excellent local and pelvic control, but it is associated with vaginal toxicity and intercourse problems. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the dysfunctions of the sexual sphere in patients with cervical cancer undergoing different cervix cancer treatments. Materials and Methods: We performed a comprehensive literature search using Pub med, Scopus and Cochrane to identify all the full articles evaluating the dysfunctions of the sexual sphere. ClinicalTrials.gov was searched for ongoing or recently completed trials, and PROSPERO was searched for ongoing or recently completed systematic reviews. Results: One thousand three hundred fifty-six women included in five studies published from 2016 to 2022 were analyzed. The median age was 50 years (range 46–56 years). The median follow-up was 12 months (range 0–60). Cervical cancer diagnosis and treatment (radiotherapy, chemotherapy and surgery) negatively affected sexual intercourse. Sexual symptoms such as fibrosis, strictures, decreased elasticity and depth and mucosal atrophy promote sexual dysfunction by causing frigidity, lack of lubrication, arousal, orgasm and libido and dyspareunia. Conclusions: Physical, physiological and social factors all contribute to the modification of the sexual sphere. Cervical cancer survivors who were irradiated have lower sexual and vaginal function than the normal population. Although there are cures for reducing discomfort, effective communication about sexual dysfunctions following treatment is essential.","https://www.mdpi.com/1648-9144/58/9/1223/pdf?version=1662380026"

Sarcopenia, defined as the loss of muscle mass and function, is known to cause adverse health outcomes. The purpose of this umbrella review was to integrate published systematic reviews and meta-analyses exploring sarcopenia and lung cancer to provide comprehensive knowledge on their relationship. Methods Eligible studies were searched from scientific databases until June 28, 2022. Critical appraisal was performed using A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) 2. The impact of sarcopenia on the pathophysiology, prevalence, and prognosis of lung cancer is summarized at the level of systematic reviews or meta-analyses. Results Fourteen reviews and meta-analyses were conducted. The methodological quality was high for one review, low for nine, and critically low for four. The most common standard for diagnosing sarcopenia in the lung cancer population is computed tomography (CT) to measure the skeletal muscle index at the third lumbar vertebra (L3). Sarcopenia was highly prevalent among patients with lung cancer, with a pooled prevalence ranging from 42.8% to 45.0%. The association between sarcopenia and increased postoperative complications and decreased disease control rates with immune checkpoint inhibitors has been demonstrated. Mortality was significantly higher in sarcopenic patients than in non-sarcopenic patients with lung cancer, regardless of the stage of disease or type of treatment. Conclusions Sarcopenia is a poor prognostic factor for lung cancer. Future studies are necessary to clarify the pathophysiology of sarcopenia and develop effective interventions for sarcopenia in patients with lung cancer.","https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12672-022-00576-0.pdf"

Probiotics have been shown to exert anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to investigate whether probiotics can prevent cancer therapy–induced oral mucositis. We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases for trials related to probiotics and oral mucositis published before September 2022; no language restrictions were applied. The primary outcome was the incidence of oral mucositis and severe oral mucositis. Secondary outcomes were the requirement for enteral nutrition during treatment, body weight loss, and decreased quality of life. The study has been registered in PROSPERO (number: CRD 42022302339). Eight RCTs, including 708 patients, were reviewed; however, a meta-analysis of only seven trials could be performed. Three trials using Lactobacilli-based probiotics reported that the incidence of oral mucositis in the probiotic group was significantly low (risk ratio [RR] = 0.84, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.77–0.93, p = 0.0004). Seven trials reported a significantly low incidence of severe oral mucositis in the probiotic group (RR = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.53–0.81, p < 0.0001). The requirement of enteral nutrition was significantly low in the probiotic group (odds ratio = 0.34, 95% CI: 0.13–0.92, p < 0.05).

A high prevalence of late breast cancer diagnosis and treatment has been reported predominantly in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs), including those in Asia. Thus, this study utilized a mixed-methods systematic review to synthesize the health system barriers influencing timely breast cancer diagnosis and treatment among women in Asian countries. We systematically searched five electronic databases for studies published in English from 2012 to 2022 on health system barriers that influence timely breast cancer diagnosis and treatment among women in Asian countries. The review was conducted per the methodology for systematic reviews and reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, while health system barriers were extracted and classified based on the World Health Organization (WHO)‘s Health Systems Framework. The mixed-methods appraisal tool was used to assess the methodological quality of the included studies. Twenty-six studies were included in this review. Fifteen studies were quantitative, nine studies were qualitative, and two studies used a mixed-methods approach. These studies were conducted across ten countries in Asia. This review identified health systems barriers that influence timely breast cancer diagnosis and treatment. The factors were categorized under the following: (1) delivery of health services (2) health workforce (3) financing for health (4) health information system and (5) essential medicines and technology. Delivery of health care (low quality of health care) was the most occurring barrier followed by the health workforce (unavailability of physicians), whilst health information systems were identified as the least barrier. This study concluded that health system factors such as geographical accessibility to treatment, misdiagnosis, and long waiting times at health facilities were major barriers to early breast cancer diagnosis and treatment among Asian women in LMICs. Eliminating these barriers will require deliberate health system strengthening, such as improving training for the health workforce and establishing more healthcare facilities.","https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s12913-022-08927-x"

Data on patient populations that have been treated in the real-world setting may provide an insight into changes of patient characteristics and prognosis over time. Methods The data were extracted from the prospective real-world registry PRAEGNANT (NCT02338167). Patients had to have HER2− HR+ advanced breast cancer in the first-line metastatic setting. The chosen therapies were described as well as progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in relation to the given therapies and time periods during which they were indicated. Results CDK4/6 inhibitors have been rapidly implemented since their introduction in November 2016. In recent years (2018 – 2022), about 70 – 80% of the patient population have been treated with CDK4/6 inhibitors, while endocrine monotherapy was given to about 10% and chemotherapy to about 15% of all patients. The prognosis was worst in patients treated with chemotherapy. Recently, mainly patients with a good prognosis are being treated with endocrine monotherapy, and patients who are treated with chemotherapy have an unfavorable prognosis. The PFS and OS of patients treated with CDK4/6i + ET have remained similar over time despite changes in patient characteristics. Conclusion A treatment with CDK4/6i + ET has rapidly become the therapy standard for patients in the first-line advanced breast cancer setting. After the implementation of CDK4/6i + ET, endocrine monotherapy is only given to patients with a very favorable prognosis, while chemotherapy is provided to patients with a rather unfavorable prognosis.

Unfortunately, up to 30% of patients do not respond to BCG treatment, and up to 70% of BCG responders relapse. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved valrubicin (1998) and pembrolizumab (2020) for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive (BCGu) NMBIC. However, the complete remission rate for valrubicin and pembrolizumab was only 16% and 40.6%, respectively. ALT-803 (N-803) is an IL-15 superagonist and reduces tumor burden by promoting the proliferation and activation of NK cells and CD8+ T cells. The FDA received (23 May 2022) and accepted to review (28 July 2022) the marketing submission of ALT-803 plus BCG for the treatment of BCGu NMIBC. However, the FDA previously rejected the application for oportuzumab monatox (OM) due to a lack of data comparing it with pembrolizumab on August 20, 2021. Interestingly, the clinical efficacy and safety of ALT-803 were higher than that of pembrolizumab and OM, suggesting that ALT-803 may be approved by FDA. This review aims to further knowledge of the preclinical and clinical evidence of ALT-803 in the treatment of NMIBC and discuss its translational potential.","https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2022.1040669/pdf"

This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and clinical outcomes of atezolizumab plus etoposide/platinum (EP). Methods Data obtained in this retrospective study were captured from six oncology units of five medical facilities from January 2019 to April 2022. For first-line treatments, atezolizumab combined with EP vs. EP alone, we primarily evaluated progression-free survival (PFS); other efficacy indicators, including overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and patterns of SCLC progression and adverse events (AEs) were assessed. Results The primary analysis included data from 225 patients, of whom 133 received EP along with atezolizumab (atezolizumab group) and 92 received EP alone (EP group). The PFS duration of the atezolizumab group [7.10 months; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 6.53-9.00] exceeded that of the EP group (6.50 months; 95% CI, 4.83-7.53). Overall, the hazard ratio (HR) was 0.69 (95% CI, 0.49-0.97) (P=0.029); particularly, the HR was 0.54 (95% CI, 0.36-0.80) among patients undergoing ≥4 chemotherapy cycles and 0.33 (95% CI, 0.20-0.56) among individuals with atezolizumab maintenance. The ORR and disease-control rate (DCR) were similar between the two groups. Because of incomplete OS data, the median OS was not determined for either group. Bone marrow suppression was the most common AE detected (58.6%) in the atezolizumab group. Immune-related AEs occurred in 19 patients in the atezolizumab group (14.3%), with only one case of grade 3 encephalitis. Conclusions This RW study in China demonstrated improved clinical outcomes of atezolizumab along with EP for ES-SCLC, particularly in the chemosensitive population. These results align with the results of the IMpower133 study, although the impact of this treatment modality on OS warrants additional follow-up studies.","https://doi.org/10.21147/j.issn.1000-9604.2022.04.04"

The patient, diagnostic, and treatment intervals are considered core indicators for early diagnosis and treatment. This review estimated the median duration of these intervals for various types of cancer and compared it across high- and lower-income countries. Methods and findings We conducted a systematic review with meta-analysis (prospectively registered protocol CRD42020200752). Three databases (MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science) and information sources including grey literature (Google Scholar, OpenGrey, EThOS, ProQuest Dissertations & Theses) were searched. Eligible articles were published during 2009 to 2022 and reported the duration of the following intervals in adult patients diagnosed with primary symptomatic cancer: patient interval (from the onset of symptoms to first presentation to a healthcare professional), diagnostic interval (from first presentation to diagnosis), and treatment interval (from diagnosis to treatment start). Interval duration was recorded in days and study medians were combined in a pooled estimate with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The methodological quality of studies was assessed using the Aarhus checklist. A total of 410 articles representing 68 countries and reporting on 5,537,594 patients were included. The majority of articles reported data from high-income countries (n = 294, 72%), with 116 (28%) reporting data from lower-income countries. Pooled meta-analytic estimates were possible for 38 types of cancer. The majority of studies were conducted on patients with breast, lung, colorectal, and head and neck cancer. In studies from high-income countries, pooled median patient intervals generally did not exceed a month for most cancers. However, in studies from lower-income countries, patient intervals were consistently 1.5 to 4 times longer for almost all cancer sites. The majority of data on the diagnostic and treatment intervals came from high-income countries. Across both high- and lower-income countries, the longest diagnostic intervals were observed for hematological (71 days [95% CI 52 to 85], e.g., myelomas (83 days [47 to 145])), genitourinary (58 days [50 to 77], e.g., prostate (85 days [57 to 112])), and digestive/gastrointestinal (57 days [45 to 67], e.g., colorectal (63 days [48 to 78])) cancers. Similarly, the longest treatment intervals were observed for genitourinary (57 days [45 to 66], e.g., prostate (75 days [61 to 87])) and gynecological (46 days [38 to 54], e.g., cervical (69 days [45 to 108]) cancers. In studies from high-income countries, the implementation of cancer-directed policies was associated with shorter patient and diagnostic intervals for several cancers. This review included a large number of studies conducted worldwide but is limited by survivor bias and the inherent complexity and many possible biases in the measurement of time points and intervals in the cancer treatment pathway. In addition, the subintervals that compose the diagnostic interval (e.g., primary care interval, referral to diagnosis interval) were not considered. Conclusions These results identify the cancers where diagnosis and treatment initiation may take the longest and reveal the extent of global disparities in early diagnosis and treatment. Efforts should be made to reduce help-seeking times for cancer symptoms in lower-income countries. Estimates for the diagnostic and treatment intervals came mostly from high-income countries that have powerful health information systems in place to record such information.","https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1004110&type=printable"

We investigated the impact of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (neoCTx) adaptions on treatment outcome in 59 patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Resections with tumor‐free margins were significantly more frequent when full‐dose neoCTx was applied. We determined if patient‐derived organoids (PDOs) can be used to personalize poly‐chemotherapy regimens by pharmacotyping of treatment‐naïve and post‐neoCTx PDAC PDOs. Five out of ten CTx‐naïve PDO lines exhibited a differential response to either the FOLFIRINOX or the Gem/Pac regimen. NeoCTx PDOs showed a poor response to the neoadjuvant regimen that had been administered to the respective patient in 30% of cases. No significant difference in PDO response was noted when comparing modified treatments in which the least effective single drug was removed from the complete regimen. Drug testing of CTx‐naïve PDAC PDOs and neoCTx PDOs may be useful to guide neoadjuvant and adjuvant regimen selection, respectively. Personalizing poly‐chemotherapy regimens by omitting substances with low efficacy could potentially result in less severe side effects, thereby increasing the fraction of patients receiving a full course of neoadjuvant treatment. © 2022 The Authors.

Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is increasingly used in modern medicine. Currently, PDT is an innovative method of treating breast cancer. Irreversible damage to neoplastic tissues is associated with the use of physicochemical processes. Generating cytotoxic reactive oxygen species [singlet oxygen (1O2)] is leading to tumor cell death. At the same time, valuable information can be extracted from breast cancer cells. Photogenerated 1O2 is the major factor responsible for cell necrosis during PDT. 1O2 can react rapidly intracellularly with all organic substances. The use of photodynamic therapy on tissues in vitro creates conditions for testing various types of solutions and implementing them in in vivo treatment. This article is a review of recent advances in PDT for treatment of breast cancer. PDT is a novel cancer diagnostic and cancer treatment therapy. Therefore, an understanding of the possibility to generate a toxic form of 1O2 is necessary. The knowledge gained from the basics of PDT in vitro can be useful in biomedical applications in vivo. The current literature mentions PDT in the treatment of cancers located very deep within the human body. Therefore, the development of agents used to deliver 1O2 to the deep cancerous tissue is a new challenge which can have an efficient impact on this discipline. This review covers the literature between 2000-2022.","http://jab.zsf.jcu.cz/doi/10.32725/jab.2022.013.pdf"

Prior to the recent U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approvals of immunotherapy, there had been no standard of care for women after failing front-line carboplatin and paclitaxel. In May 2017, the FDA approved single-agent pembrolizumab in microsatellite instability high (MSI-H)/mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) endometrial cancer patients following failure of systemic therapy. Then, in September 2019, the FDA approved pembrolizumab and lenvatinib for women who are not MSI-H or are MMR-proficient. This approval was based on KEYNOTE-146 and Study 111. Among 94 non–MSI-H women, 80% of those treated with pembrolizumab and lenvatinib had tumor shrinkage, and 38.3% had objective response by RECIST 1.1 as assessed by an independent radiology committee.

According to 2022 statistics from the World Health Organization (WHO), close to 10 million deaths have been reported in 2020 and it is estimated that the number of cancer cases world-wide could increase to 21.6 million by 2030. Breast, lung, thyroid, pancreatic, liver, prostate, bladder, kidney, pelvis, colon, and rectum cancers are the most prevalent. Each year, approximately 400,000 children develop cancer. Treatment between countries vary, but usually includes either surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy. Modern treatments such as hormone-, immuno- and antibody-based therapies are becoming increasingly popular. Several recent reports have been published on toxins, antibiotics, bacteriocins, non-ribosomal peptides, polyketides, phenylpropanoids, phenylflavonoids, purine nucleosides, short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and enzymes with anticancer properties.

Traditional chemotherapy reduces the quality of life of patients without significantly improving survival. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical characteristics of patients with VC and the prognosis by using different treatment options. Methods According to the 5th European School of Oncology (ESO)–European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) international consensus guidelines for advanced breast cancer guidelines (ABC 5), patients who were treated in the First Hospital of Jilin University from 2018 to 2022 and diagnosed with breast cancer VC were retrospectively analyzed. The analysis focused on the characteristics of the patients, the treatment regimens, and prognosis. Results A total of 133 patients were included in this study. As for metastasis breast cancer subtype, 92 (69.18%) were hormone receptor (HR) positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) negative, 20 (15.04%) had HER-2 overexpression, and 21 (15.78%) were triple negative. All patients had an mOS of 11.2 months (range, 1.1–107.8 months). In different types of VC, the median overall survival (mOS) of bone marrow metastasis (BMM) was 18.0 months (range, 2.0–107.8 months), that of diffuse liver metastasis (DLM) was 8.1 months (range, 1.3–30.2 months), and that of meningeal metastasis (MM) was 9.0 months (range, 1.2–53.8 months). In 92 HR+, Her-2− patients using different treatment regimens, mOS was 6.2 months (range, 1.2–29.8 months) in the chemotherapy group while it was 24.3 months (range, 3.1–107.8 months) in the endocrine therapy (ET) group. Multivariate Cox regression analysis suggested that Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scores and type of VC were associated with survival. Conclusion Prognosis varied in different types of VC. Patients with BMM had the best prognosis, and DLM had the worst. As treatment options continue to progress, our retrospective study showed a significant prolongation of overall survival (OS) in patients with VC compared to previous studies.","https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fonc.2022.1048781/pdf"

The aim of this study was to comprehensively evaluate and summarize the current evidence of PD-(L)1 inhibitors in the treatment of cancer. Methods A comprehensive search of SRs, which included meta-analyses of PD-(L)1 inhibitors on cancer, was performed on eight databases with a cutoff date of 1 January 2022. Two authors independently identified SRs, extracted data, assessed the report quality according to the guidance of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement, evaluated the methodological quality by the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews 2 (AMSTAR 2), and appraised the quality of evidence by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE). Results A total of 172 SRs with meta-analysis met the inclusion criteria. The report quality of included SRs was quite good, with 128 (74.42%) SRs of high quality and 44 (25.58%) of moderate quality. The methodological quality was alarming, as only one (0.58%) SR had high quality, five (2.91%) SRs had low quality, and the other 166 (96.51%) SRs had critically low quality. For GRADE, 38 (3.77%) outcomes had high-quality evidence, 288 (28.57%) moderate, 545 (54.07%) low, and 137 (13.59%) critically low-quality evidence. Current evidence indicated that treatment with PD-(L)1 inhibitors were significantly effective in non-small cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, malignant melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, and urothelial carcinoma, breast cancer, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma with PD-L1 expression level≥1%, whereas the evidence in gastroesophageal and colorectal tumors is still controversial. Monotherapy with PD-(L)1 inhibitors was associated with a lower frequency of any grade and high-grade adverse events (AEs). The incidence of any grade and high-grade AEs caused by PD-(L)1 inhibitors in combination with other therapies was no lower than the controls. However, PD-(L)1 inhibitors were associated with a higher frequency of any grade and high-grade immune-related AEs. Conclusions PD-(L)1 inhibitors appeared to be effective and safe for cancer treatment, except for gastrointestinal tumors; however, the quality of the evidence is not convincing.

In the near future the data obtained from ctDNA may routinely be used for finding minimal residual disease, detecting relapse, determining either the unknown primary tumor, or the site of metastases. It can also be used for deciding upon the appropriate efficiency of the therapy and/or emerging resistance to the therapy. Therefore, clinicians should be aware of the potentials and the limitations of the assays. Of course, several open questions are still under research and as a result, cfDNA and ctDNA testing are not part of routine care yet. Abstract The aim of this review is to evaluate the present status of the use of cell-free DNA and its fraction of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) because this year July 2022, an ESMO guideline was published regarding the application of ctDNA in patient care. This review is for clinical oncologists to explain the concept, the terms used, the pros and cons of ctDNA; thus, the technical aspects of the different platforms are not reviewed in detail, but we try to help in navigating the current knowledge in liquid biopsy. Since the validated and adequately sensitive ctDNA assays have utility in identifying actionable mutations to direct targeted therapy, ctDNA may be used for this soon in routine clinical practice and in other different areas as well. The cfDNA fragments can be obtained by liquid biopsy and can be used for diagnosis, prognosis, and selecting among treatment options in cancer patients. A great proportion of cfDNA comes from normal cells of the body or from food uptake. Only a small part (<1%) of it is related to tumors, originating from primary tumors, metastatic sites, or circulating tumor cells (CTCs). Soon the data obtained from ctDNA may routinely be used for finding minimal residual disease, detecting relapse, and determining the sites of metastases. It might also be used for deciding appropriate therapy, and/or emerging resistance to the therapy and the data analysis of ctDNA may be combined with imaging or other markers. However, to achieve this goal, further clinical validations are inevitable. As a result, clinicians should be aware of the limitations of the assays. Of course, several open questions are still under research and because of it cfDNA and ctDNA testing are not part of routine care yet.","https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/14/24/6115/pdf?version=1670837409"

Skin cancer is a global concern with an increasing trend, hence novel therapies are essential. The local treatment strategies play a key role in skin cancer therapy. Nanoparticles (NPs) exert potential applications in medicine with huge advantages and have the ability to overcome common chemotherapy problems. Recently, NPs have been used in nanomedicine as promising drug delivery systems. They can enhance the solubility of poorly water-soluble drugs, improve pharmacokinetic properties, modify bioavailability, and reduce drug metabolism. The high-efficient, nontoxic, low-cost, and specific cancer therapy is a promising goal, which can be achieved by the development of nanotechnology. Metallic NPs (MNPs) can act as important platforms. MNPs development seeks to enhance the therapeutic efficiency of medicines through site specificity, prevention of multidrug resistance, and effective delivery of therapeutic factors. MNPs are used as potential arms in the case of cancer recognition, such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and colloidal mediators for magnetic hyperthermia of cancer. The applications of MNPs in the cancer treatment studies are mostly due to their potential to carry a large dose of drug, resulting in a high concentration of anticancer drugs at the target site. Therefore, off-target toxicity and suffering side effects caused by high concentration of the drug in other parts of the body are avoided. MNPs have been applied as drug carriers for the of improvement of skin cancer treatment and drug delivery. The development of MNPs improves the results of many cancer treatments. Different types of NPs, such as inorganic and organic NPs have been investigated in vitro and in vivo for the skin cancer therapy. MNPs advantages mostly include biodegradability, electrostatic charge, good biocompatibility, high drug payload, and low toxicity. However, the use of controlled-release systems stimulated by electromagnetic waves, temperature, pH, and light improves the accumulation in tumor tissues and improves therapeutic outcomes. This study (2019-2022) is aimed at reviewing applications of MNPs in the skin cancer therapy.","https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2022/2346941.pdf"

They also impose a large economic burden on patients, their families, and health insurance systems. Notably, cancers and the adverse reactions to their therapeutic options, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, dramatically affect the quality of life of afflicted patients. Therefore, developing approaches to manage chemotherapy- and radiotherapy-induced adverse reactions gained greater attention in recent years. Glycyrrhiza glabra (licorice), a perennial plant that is one of the most frequently used herbs in traditional Chinese medicine, has been heavily investigated in relation to cancer therapy. Licorice/licorice-related regimes, used in combination with chemotherapy, may improve the adverse effects of chemotherapy. However, there is little awareness of licorice-containing herbs alleviating reactions to radiotherapy and chemotherapy, or to other induced adverse reactions in cancer treatment. We aimed to provide a descriptive review, and to emphasize the possibility that licorice-related medicines could be used as an adjuvant regimen with chemotherapy to improve quality of life (QoL) and to reduce side effects, thus, improving compliance with chemotherapy. The experimental method involved searching different databases, including PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and Wang Fang database, as of May 2022, to identify any relevant studies. Despite a lack of high-quality and large-scale randomized controlled trials, we still discovered the potential benefits of licorice-containing herbs from published clinical studies. These studies find that licorice-containing herbs, and their active ingredients, reduce the adverse reactions caused by chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and improve the QoL of patients. This comprehensive review will serve as a cornerstone to encourage more scientists to evaluate and develop effective Traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions to improve the side effects of chemotherapy and radiation therapy.","https://www.mdpi.com/2218-1989/12/6/535/pdf?version=1654780804"

The tumour microenvironment plays a critical role in various aspects of tumour development and progression. Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) are multipotent stem cells that have a tri-lineage differentiation capacity and are one of the key stromal cells in the tumour microenvironment. Following the interaction with cancer cells, they are transformed from naïve MSCs to tumour-associated MSCs, which substantially affect tumour growth and progression as well as the development of chemoresistance in cancer cells. The aim of this review article is to provide an overview of studies that have investigated how MSCs affect the susceptibility of cancer cells to chemotherapeutics. Their results show that MSCs protect cancer cells from chemotherapeutics by influencing several signalling pathways. This knowledge is crucial for the development of new treatment approaches that will lead to improved treatment outcomes. Abstract The tumour microenvironment, which is comprised of various cell types and the extracellular matrix, substantially impacts tumour initiation, progression, and metastasis. Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) are one of the key stromal cells in the tumour microenvironment, and their interaction with cancer cells results in the transformation of naïve MSCs to tumour-associated MSCs. The latter has an important impact on tumour growth and progression. Recently, it has been shown that they can also contribute to the development of chemoresistance in cancer cells. This review provides an overview of 42 studies published between 1 January 2001 and 1 January 2022 that examined the effect of MSCs on the susceptibility of cancer cells to chemotherapeutics. The studies showed that MSCs affect various signalling pathways in cancer cells, leading to protection against chemotherapy-induced damage. Promising results emerged from the use of inhibitors of various signalling pathways that are affected in cancer cells due to interactions with MSCs in the tumour microenvironment. These studies present a good starting point for the investigation of novel treatment approaches and demonstrate the importance of targeting the stroma in the tumour microenvironment to improve treatment outcomes.","https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/14/15/3761/pdf?version=1659434146"

Introduction Breast cancer (BC) is a powerful example of the intraand interpatient heterogeneity of tumours; thus, there remain several grey areas in BC treatment approaches. This is especially true for advanced/metastatic disease (mBC) [1–3]. Organoid cultures are suitable models for studying the histological complexity and genetic heterogeneity of parental tumours and can be used to assess treatment strategies for challenging diseases such as mBC. Here, we report a proof-of-concept test case using organoid cultures from metastatic BC specimens to rapidly test drug sensitivity and molecular-lesion-driven treatments. Based on the relevant impact of PIK3CA gene mutations on breast cancer progression and resistance to therapy [4], we assessed the efficacy of alpelisib (BYL719; Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland), a specific PI3K-α inhibitor, on organoid cultures derived from multisite mBC samples carrying specific PIK3CA gene mutations. Results An 82-year-old woman was diagnosed in 2018 with invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) of the right breast, grade 3, ER-/PR-/HER2 3 + , that had metastasized to the lymph nodes and bone. In 2019, contrast-enhanced brain computed tomography (CT) revealed a 3.9 cm cerebellar lesion that was surgically removed (Fig. 1A-C). We derived organoid cultures from this brain metastatic material (mOGs) by using a slightly modified organoid growth medium (OGM) containing neuregulin-1 to match the aberrant expression of ERBB family members in the starting material (Fig. 1D) [5, 6]. Using NGS-customized panels containing breast cancer-specific hotspot regions for 63 genes, we identified the PIK3CA H1047L mutation in both the patient-derived organoid (PDO) and the metastatic sample tissue, with variant allele frequencies (VAFs) of 45.4% and 56%, respectively (Fig. 1E and Suppl. Table 1). PIK3CA hotspot mutations drive oncogenic progression in several cancer settings [4]. These mutations occur in 30–40% of breast cancers and are associated with resistance to therapy and metastatic progression [7, 8]. We found that a very minor fraction of genes assessed in the mBC-PDOs exhibited different expression levels when compared with the brain metastasis sample of origin (Fig. 1F).

A systematic review was performed in May 2022 to summarize available evidence about the diagnosis, management, and outcomes of these patients. Twenty-seven studies involving 252 patients were identified. Overall, 163 (64.7%) and 89 (35.3%) patients had synchronous and metachronous PCa and CRC, respectively. In patients with synchronous diseases, PCa treatment involved active surveillance in 1 patient, radical prostatectomy (RP) in 36 patients, radiotherapy (RT) in 60 patients, RP plus RT in 1 patient, proton beam therapy in 1 patient, and cryoablation in 1 patient. In patients with previous CRC treatment, prostate biopsy was mostly performed by transrectal approach (n = 24). The trans-perineal and suprapubic approaches were adopted in 12 and 6 cases, respectively. Surgical PCa treatment in these cases involved endoscopic extraperitoneal RP, robot-assisted RP, and not otherwise specified RP in 30, 15, and 2 cases, respectively. Biochemical recurrence rates ranged from 20% to 28%. Non-surgical PCa treatment options included brachytherapy, RT plus androgen deprivation therapy, and RT alone in 23, 2 and 4 patients, respectively. PCa specific survival was reported by one study and was 100%.","https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4418/12/6/1475/pdf?version=1655440910"
